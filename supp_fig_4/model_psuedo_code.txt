Start in neutral zone
For each second of CO2 stimulus (10 minutes):
    If CO2 detected based on concentration dependent probability:
        enter CO2 zone
    If time spent in CO2 zone > 2 minutes (or 30 seconds for 15% CO2):
        enter clean air zone
    If time spent in clean air zone > 30 minutes:
        enter neutral zone
